### Anchors
 Anchors are a fundamental concept in regular expressions, helping determine the position of a match in a string. They don't match actual characters in the string but rather positions.

 # Two primary anchors:
- Caret (^):
This anchor matches the start of a string.
For example, ^A will match any string that starts with the letter 'A'.
In multiline mode (usually with the m flag), ^ can also match the start of a line.
- Dollar ($):
This anchor matches the end of a string.
For example, B$ will match any string that ends with the letter 'B'.
In multiline mode, $ can also match the end of a line.

Usage examples:
- `^abc`: Matches any string that starts with "abc".
- `xyz$`: Matches any string that ends with "xyz".
- `^abc$`: Matches the string "abc" in its entirety, without any characters before or after.
- `^$`: Matches an empty string.

Anchors work best when you have specific constraints on the position of a match. They are especially useful when you want to ensure that a pattern matches an entire string or line.
